# House Prices Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. It is built primarily using Jupyter Notebooks, allowing for interactive analysis, visualization, and model development.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze housing data, extract meaningful insights, and build predictive models capable of estimating house prices. The workflow typically includes:

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Evaluation of model performance

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggleâ€™s competition:
ðŸ‘‰ House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

To run the notebook, download the dataset from Kaggle and place the files in the Dataset/ folder with the following structure:

   ```bash
Dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ train.csv   
â””â”€â”€ test.csv   
   ```


## Getting Started
